## What is Cheese 3D? ##

Cheese 3D is a model viewer aiming to provide artists with rapid rendering of their textured models with a multitude of effects to aid in texture creating, material defining and general visualization of their model. The application will be written in C++ and will use the OpenGL API.


## What features are planned for Cheese 3D? ##

  * Arbitrary rotations of textured meshes at arbitrary positions.
  * Support for rendering multiple meshes at once.
  * Support for multiple lights.
  * Interactive frame rate.
  * Mesh & UV visualization tools (Wire-frame, vertices, UV-values etc).
